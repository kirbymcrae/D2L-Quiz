# D2L-Quiz
This program takes in the raw data file from a Desire2Learn (D2L) quiz and outputs class wide data as well as individual student data. D2L is the learning managment system used at Montana State University and one of the primary methods for online quizzes and tests.  

For now this program is not interactive and is still underdevelopment, however most of the underlying R code has been completed and it just has to be transfered into a Shiny app. The current output can be seen at http://rpubs.com/kirbymcrae/d2lquiztableexample.
